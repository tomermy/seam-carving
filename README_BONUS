Description:
We implemented the showSeams() method as follows:
- Find the K seams that would have been removed.
- Using the stored data of the K seams, in order to target the suitable pixels
	on the working image copy and color them in the required color input.
	Each Seam pixel holds the matching pixel mapping of the original image.

Code Documentation:
    /**
     * This method colors the pixels which would have been used
     * to construct seams in order to reduce/increase the image size
     * based on the Seam carving algorithm.
     * @param seamColorRGB - Color chosen for seam pixels.
     * @return - Copy of the image including the colored pixels.
     */
